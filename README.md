### 🕹️ Features & Mechanics
Although this was a short one-week sprint, the prototype includes several core arcade mechanics:
* **Dynamic Player Movement:** A fluid 3-state animation controller allowing the player to Run, Jump, and Slide under varying obstacles.
* **The "Ghost" Chaser:** A persistent enemy that follows the player, creating time-pressure and forcing accurate platforming.
* **Procedural Obstacles:** An infinite spawning system that generates boulders, traffic cones, and toll barriers.
* **Parallax Environment:** A multi-layered scrolling background that gives the retro city a great sense of depth and speed.
